# Entity-Oriented Search: Fundamentals

How modern search engines (both traditional and AI-driven) understand, organize, and retrieve information around *entities* — real-world objects, people, places, concepts — rather than just keywords or documents. Based on [[entity-oriented-search-balog-2018]].

## What Is an Entity?

An **entity** is a uniquely identifiable object or "thing" in the world, characterized by:

- **Unique identifier**: A reference that maps one-to-one to the real-world object (e.g., Wikipedia article ID for "Albert Einstein", Freebase ID /m/0dl567)
- **Name(s) and aliases**: An entity may have multiple surface forms ("Einstein", "Albert Einstein", "A. Einstein", "The father of relativity")
- **Type(s)**: Semantic categories (PERSON, LOCATION, ORGANIZATION, PRODUCT, EVENT, etc.). An entity may have multiple types.
- **Attributes**: Properties or features (birth date, location, height, nationality for a person; population, coordinates, official language for a place)
- **Relationships**: How entities connect to other entities (e.g., "Einstein worked at Princeton", "Einstein was awarded the Nobel Prize")

**Practical examples:**
- **Apple** (entity): has types {COMPANY, ORGANIZATION}, names {Apple, Apple Inc., AAPL}, attributes {founded: 1976, founder: Steve Jobs}, relationships {Steve Jobs → founded, iPhone → product}
- **New York City** (entity): type {LOCATION, CITY}, names {NYC, New York, NY}, attributes {population: 8.3M, coordinates: 40.7128°N, 74.0060°W}, relationships {USA → country, New York → state}
- **The Beatles** (entity): type {MUSICAL_GROUP, ORGANIZATION}, names {The Beatles, Beatles}, attributes {formed: 1960, members: John Lennon, Paul McCartney, ...}, relationships {members, albums, record labels}

## Knowledge Representation: Hierarchy

Modern search systems store entity information at three levels:

### 1. Entity Catalog

A dictionary of entity names and unique identifiers.

- **Minimal information**: For each entity, record its ID and name(s)
- **Example**: {"Albert Einstein": /m/0dl567, "Einstein": /m/0dl567, "A. Einstein": /m/0dl567, ...}
- **Purpose**: Enable entity recognition and lookup

### 2. Knowledge Repository

A semi-structured or structured collection of entities with types, descriptions, and properties.

- **Content**: Entity type information, textual descriptions (e.g., Wikipedia article), entity attributes, and relationships (non-typed links)
- **Examples**: Wikipedia (semi-structured: articles + categories + hyperlinks), DBpedia (structured: RDF triples)
- **Structure**: Flexible; entities can have varying attributes; descriptions are in natural language
- **Scale**: Typically tens of millions of entities (Wikipedia: 6.7M articles, DBpedia: ~14M entities)

### 3. Knowledge Base

A fully structured knowledge repository containing **facts** as subject-predicate-object (SPO) triples.

- **Content**: Structured assertions about entities ("Einstein" —educatedAt→ "University of Zurich", "Einstein" —spouse→ "Elsa Einstein")
- **Format**: RDF (Resource Description Framework) using URIs to identify entities and predicates (relations)
- **Examples**: Freebase (now merged into Google's Knowledge Graph), DBpedia, YAGO, Wikidata
- **Structure**: Highly formalized; every fact is machine-readable; consistent schema
- **Scale**: Billions of triples (Freebase: 1.9B triples before acquisition; Google Knowledge Graph: 500B+ triples)

**Relationship:** Catalog ⊂ Repository ⊂ Knowledge Base. A KB has all the properties of a repository (plus structured facts), but a repository may lack the strict structure of a KB.

## Entity-Oriented Search: Definition

**Entity-oriented search** = the information retrieval paradigm where:
- Information is organized and accessed around **entities** (and their attributes/relationships)
- Rather than around documents (traditional IR) or keywords (keyword search)
- Users interact with specific entities, not generic search results

### Why Entities?

**User benefit:**
- Entities are how humans naturally think about information: "Tell me about Einstein" (entity) vs. "show me documents matching 'Einstein'" (document results)
- Richer UX: entity cards, knowledge panels, related entities, attribute summaries
- Explicit disambiguation: users see "Albert Einstein (physicist)" vs. "Albert Einstein (mountain)" upfront

**Machine benefit:**
- Entities capture semantic meaning: knowing a query mentions "Einstein" and "Nobel Prize" lets a system infer the user wants information about Einstein receiving the Nobel Prize
- Better context understanding: documents about "Princeton" linked to entity "Einstein" reveals the document discusses Einstein's Princeton years
- Enables implicit matching: documents mentioning related entities (e.g., "University of Zurich") can match queries about those entities even without keyword overlap

## Entity Linking: Connecting Text to Knowledge Bases

**Entity linking** = the task of recognizing entity mentions in unstructured text and linking them to structured knowledge base entries.

Example: Document text "Einstein was born in Ulm, Germany" → recognize mentions {Einstein, Ulm, Germany} → link to KG entities {/m/0dl567 (Albert Einstein), /m/04v5g (Ulm), /m/09c7w (Germany)}

### The Entity Linking Pipeline

**Stage 1: Mention Detection**
- Identify text spans (phrases) that potentially refer to entities
- Techniques: lexicon-based dictionary matching, Named Entity Recognition (NER) neural models
- Challenge: Entities have multiple names and aliases; "Einstein" could refer to Albert or another Einstein
- Output: List of (mention text, position) for all potential entity references

**Stage 2: Candidate Selection**
- For each mention, generate a ranked list of candidate entities from the knowledge base
- Techniques: String matching (edit distance), knowledge base lookup by mention text
- Challenge: Balance recall (find the correct entity) vs. precision (avoid too many candidates)
- Output: For each mention, top-k ranked candidate entities with scores

**Stage 3: Disambiguation**
- Select the single best entity for each mention, using document context
- Techniques: Entity relatedness (related entities co-occur in documents), entity popularity, mention context (surrounding words)
- Challenge: "Einstein" in isolation is ambiguous; "Einstein won the Nobel Prize" disambiguates to Albert Einstein
- Output: For each mention, linked entity ID or rejection (not linkable)

### Entity Disambiguation vs. Related Tasks

- **Named Entity Recognition (NER)**: Detecting and classifying entity mentions (e.g., "Albert Einstein" → PERSON). Focus: detection + classification, not linking to a KB.
- **Named Entity Disambiguation (NED)**: Assigning entity identifiers to mentions (the linking step). Focus: mapping to KB, not detection.
- **Entity Coreference Resolution**: Clustering mentions so co-referring mentions are grouped (e.g., "Einstein", "He", "the physicist" all cluster together). Focus: grouping, not KB linking.

Entity linking subsumes coreference resolution: if two mentions link to the same entity, they co-refer.

## Entity-Based Query Expansion

**Problem:** Keyword queries are short and ambiguous ("Einstein Nobel Prize" — about the prize itself? Einstein receiving it? Other uses?)

**Solution:** Expand queries with semantically related terms from entity descriptions:

1. **Map query to entities**: Identify which entities the query mentions or implies
   - Explicit: query contains entity mention ("Einstein" → entity Albert Einstein)
   - Implicit: query likely refers to entities even without direct mention ("Nobel Prize physics" → infer entities NOBEL_PRIZE, PHYSICS, and possibly related physicists)

2. **Extract expansion terms**: From matched entity description, extract relevant terms:
   - Entity names and aliases
   - Entity types and attributes
   - Related entities
   - Terms from entity Wikipedia article

3. **Rank expansion terms**: Not all terms are equally valuable:
   - Term frequency: How often the term appears in the entity description
   - Term spread: How many different sections/fields of the description include it
   - Term proximity: How close it appears to original query terms
   - Taxonomy: Whether related entities share types with the query entity

4. **Expand query**: Use expansion terms to re-rank documents:
   - Traditional: combine original query + expansion terms for second retrieval round
   - Sophisticated: project query into latent entity space and rank documents by entity similarity

**Result:** Documents about "Einstein" can be ranked higher for "Nobel Prize physics" even if they don't mention "Nobel Prize" or "physics" explicitly, because the document's entity mentions are related to those concepts.

## Entity-Oriented vs. Semantic Search

**Relationship:** Often used interchangeably, but technically distinct:

- **Semantic search**: Understanding the *meaning* of a query and documents (interpreting intent, synonyms, concept relationships). Broader term.
- **Entity-oriented search**: Organizing information around *entities* as the fundamental unit (distinct from documents or keywords). A specific instantiation of semantic search.

Entity-oriented search *is* a form of semantic search, but semantic search doesn't require entities (e.g., topic modeling, latent semantic indexing).

## Practical Relevance for SEO/AEO

### Traditional Search (Google, Bing)
- Google Knowledge Graph (2012 onward): entities as first-class ranking/display units
- Entity cards: rich displays of entity information in SERPs
- Related entities and "People also search for": entity-based recommendations
- Interpretation of queries as entity queries: "restaurants in New York" → entities {RESTAURANT, NEW_YORK}

### AI Search (ChatGPT, Claude, Google AI Overviews, Perplexity)
- AI systems rely on entity linking to ground responses: which real-world entities are mentioned in the query/answer?
- Entity-based context: to understand if a mention of "bank" refers to financial institution or riverbank, systems link to entity knowledge
- Knowledge base integration: AI systems consult knowledge bases (sometimes Google Knowledge Graph, sometimes web-indexed entity info) to verify factual claims

### Content Strategy
- **Entity clarity**: Ensure entities in your content are unambiguously expressed (full names, types, relationships) so systems correctly link mentions to knowledge bases
- **Entity comprehensiveness**: Cover relevant entity attributes and relationships → enables entity expansion and entity-based ranking
- **Entity mentions**: Content that mentions relevant entities (people, places, organizations, concepts) scores better for entity-oriented retrieval than purely keyword-focused content
- **Schema markup**: Implementing schema.org markup makes entity properties machine-readable, aiding entity extraction and linking
