# AI Coding Agent Tool Selection

A sibling domain to [[generative-engine-optimization]]: instead of a
chat/search answer engine choosing which *content* to cite, a coding
agent (Claude Code and similar) chooses which *tool or library* to
recommend and install when a developer asks an open-ended question
("add a database," "how do I deploy this?") without naming a specific
product. For a tool/library vendor, "visibility" here means being the
thing the agent actually reaches for — the audience is developers using
AI coding agents, not searchers or chat users. Based on
[[amplifying-claude-code-picks-2026]] (Claude Code, 2,430 prompts, 20
categories, 3 models) and [[amplifying-codex-vs-claude-code-picks-2026]]
(Codex vs. Claude Code head-to-head, 1,452 picks, 12 contested
categories).

## Agents build rather than buy, often

In 12 of 20 tool categories studied, a coding agent's most common
response is to write a custom/DIY implementation rather than recommend
a third-party tool — 12% of all primary picks overall, rising to 100%
for Python authentication and 69% for feature flags. This is the
single largest "competitor" to any given tool: it's not just other
vendors, it's the agent's own code-generation capability.

## A default stack exists, where agents do pick a tool

Where third-party tools are chosen, agents converge heavily on a small
consistent set — near-monopolies in some categories (CI/CD: GitHub
Actions 93.8%; Payments: Stripe 91.4%; UI: shadcn/ui 90.1%), strong
defaults in others (Styling: Tailwind 68.4%; State: Zustand 64.8%;
Observability: Sentry 63.1%), and genuinely competitive/fragmented
markets in the rest (Auth, Caching, ORM, Background Jobs, Real-time).
Deployment, testing, and ORM choice are ecosystem-specific (Vercel vs.
Railway, Vitest vs. pytest, Drizzle vs. SQLModel) rather than one
universal winner — the agent picks contextually, not by rote.

## "Known but unpicked" is a distinct, worse state than invisible

Some tools are actively considered and then passed over every time:
Redux (0 primary picks despite 23 mentions), MongoDB (0 primary despite
30 mentions), Prisma (0 picks from the newest model tested despite
being dominant in the older model). This is a stronger negative signal
than never appearing in training data at all — the agent has evaluated
the tool and rejected it as the default. Conversely, tools with a high
*alternative*-pick rate but low primary rate (Netlify, SendGrid, Yarn,
TanStack Query in some categories) are "known and viable" — closer to
becoming the default than a tool that never surfaces.

## Recency gradient: newer models favor newer tools

Comparing successive model versions on the same prompts shows a
systematic drift toward newer tools, sometimes total: Prisma (2019)
drops from 79% pick share to 0% while Drizzle (2022) rises from 21% to
100%, across Sonnet 4.5 → Opus 4.5 → Opus 4.6. Similar shifts appear in
background-job libraries and caching choices. This implies incumbency
in an older model's training data is not durable — a tool's position
can erode purely from newer models being trained on more recent code
examples, independent of any change in the tool itself. It also implies
a feedback loop risk: newer tools get recommended more → gain adoption
→ generate more training data → get recommended even more.

## Stability varies sharply by category

Some categories are highly stable — the same tool wins regardless of
prompt phrasing or which of 3 runs you check (CI/CD, Payments,
Deployment, Databases, Authentication, API Layer). Others are
genuinely fragmented or context-sensitive (Background Jobs, Caching,
File Storage, Real-time, ORM choice) — multiple tools compete with no
clear agent-side consensus, so a vendor in one of these categories has
more room to shift the outcome than a vendor competing against a
near-monopoly incumbent.

## Different agents pick differently — and it correlates with parent company

Comparing Codex (OpenAI/GPT-5.3) against Claude Code (Anthropic/Opus
4.6) head-to-head on 12 contested categories (search, secrets, rate
limiting, edge compute) finds agreement on only 7 of 12 top picks — and
6 of those 7 are agreement on Custom/DIY, not a named tool. Where they
diverge, the pattern often lines up with each agent's parent company:
Codex picks OpenAI-acquired **Statsig** as primary in 27% of feature-
flag responses vs. Claude's 0% (despite Claude *mentioning* Statsig
28% of the time); Claude picks Anthropic-acquired **Bun** as primary
63% of the time for JS runtime vs. Codex's 13% (despite Codex
mentioning Bun 73% of the time). Beyond the two acquired-tool cases,
both agents show broader platform affinity: Codex leans Cloudflare (47
Cloudflare-branded picks vs. Claude's 9), Claude leans Vercel (29
Vercel-branded picks vs. Codex's 17).

The researchers are careful to frame this as **correlation, not proven
causation** — an acquired tool may already have been best-in-class,
which is presumably why it got acquired. But the sharper finding is
about *awareness vs. conversion*: both agents mention the same
competing tools at similar rates, yet convert to a primary pick at very
different rates ("conversion differs much more than awareness does").
Being mentioned by a coding agent is not the same as being chosen by
it, and which one happens seems to depend partly on which company built
the agent.

## Practical relevance

This is a build-vs-buy and default-stack dynamic, not a citation/
ranking dynamic — closer to "which library does the agent `npm
install`" than "which page does the agent quote." See

vendor-facing tactics.
