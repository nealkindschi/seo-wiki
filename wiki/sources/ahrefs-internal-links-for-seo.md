# Internal Links for SEO: An Actionable Guide (Ahrefs)

SEO: An Actionable Guide." Ahrefs Blog. Updated 2026-03-10.

## Key takeaways

- Internal links serve three SEO functions: distributing PageRank/
  authority, feeding page discovery (crawlers follow links from known
  pages), and giving contextual/semantic signal via anchor text — on top
  of user navigation.
- Link taxonomy: navigational, contextual (in-content), breadcrumb
  (Google treats as normal links for PageRank — Gary Illyes), footer
  (lower priority), and related-content modules.
- **Pyramid/top-down site structure**: keep every page within 3 clicks
  of the homepage; John Mueller endorses this as helping Google
  understand page context.
- **Siloing + topic clusters combined**: clean folder-based URL
  structure, but don't let strict silos block contextual cross-topic
  linking — link wherever it "contextually makes sense" (Gael Breton).
- **"Reasonable surfer" model for link placement**: value correlates
  with click likelihood — in-content contextual links > nav/breadcrumbs
  > footer/deep sidebar links. Put priority links early/above-the-fold.
- **Numeric density recommendation: 3-5 contextual links per article**,
  justified via a simplified PageRank-dilution argument (~1/N per link
  for N links on a page).
- Retroactive linking during content refreshes: link new content from
  high-authority "power pages"; build topic clusters after the fact via
  pillar pages.
- Pagination should use real `<a href>` markup (not JS/onclick), with
  each paginated page self-canonicalizing (never canonicalize page 2 to
  page 1).
- Keep internal links dofollow except login/admin/duplicate-filter URLs;
  audit for accidental nofollow.
- Audit workflow: fix broken internal links (404s → 301 if backlinked,
  else remove), find orphan pages (no inbound internal links — a
  discovery and PageRank-distribution risk), and use keyword-overlap
  tooling to surface new internal-link opportunities.

## Conflict with existing wiki claim

- **Claim**: there is (or isn't) an ideal/target number of internal
  links per page.
  - Supported by (numeric target): this source — "3-5 contextual links
    per article" as the "optimal" density, derived from a PageRank-
    dilution argument.
  - Contradicted by: [[google-links-crawlable]] (2026-07-07 ingest) —
    Google's own documentation explicitly declines to give a number:
    "There's no magical ideal number of links a given page should
    contain. However, if you think it's too much, then it probably is."
  - **Current best guess**: treat "3-5" as a practical starting
    heuristic for typical blog-post-length content, not a hard rule —
    it's a third-party (Ahrefs) simplification of PageRank mechanics,
    while Google (the primary source, closer to ranking authority)
    deliberately avoids a numeric target and frames it as a
    reader-judgment call instead. Longer or more comprehensive pages
    (e.g. pillar/cornerstone content) will reasonably exceed 5 links.

## What this updated in the wiki

- Substantially expanded [[link-and-anchor-text-best-practices]]'s
  internal-linking section: site structure (pyramid/3-click rule,
  siloing + topic clusters), reasonable-surfer link placement, the
  3-5-links density heuristic (with the conflict noted above), power-
  page/content-refresh linking, pagination markup, dofollow/crawler
  accessibility, and an orphan-page/broken-link audit workflow.
- Logged a `conflict` entry in [[link-and-anchor-text-best-practices]]
  wiki/log.md regarding "ideal number of links."
