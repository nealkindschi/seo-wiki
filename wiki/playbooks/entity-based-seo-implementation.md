# Entity-Based SEO Implementation

**Why/when to use this:** Use when building or auditing content strategy to ensure you're organizing content around entities (things) rather than just keywords. Entity-based structure improves visibility in both traditional search (Knowledge Graph integration, entity cards) and AI search systems (which rely on entity recognition to ground responses). Based on [[inlinks-entity-based-seo-guide]] and [[entity-oriented-search-fundamentals]]. For treating the **brand itself** (not just in-content entities) as the entity to build out — Organization schema depth, branded-query analysis, content/amplification strategy — see [[brand-entity-seo-strategy]].

## Three-Step Implementation Framework

### Step 1: Entity Extraction

Identify the primary entity and map the surrounding entity ecosystem your content covers.

**Procedure:**

1. **Define your primary entity**
   - What is the single central "thing" your website/page is about?
   - Ideally, this entity has Wikipedia notability or strong online presence
   - Examples: a company, a concept (e.g., "machine learning"), a person, a location
   - Document: entity name, Wikipedia URL (if applicable), unique identifier (KG ID if known)

2. **Identify surrounding entities**
   - Use Named Entity Recognition (NER) tools (e.g., Inlinks, SEMrush, Clearscope) to extract all entities mentioned in your existing content
   - Or manually scan your top 10-20 pages for entity mentions (people, organizations, products, concepts, locations)
   - Document each entity found: name, frequency, relevance to primary entity, Wikipedia/knowledge base links

3. **Rank surrounding entities by relevance**
   - Which entities appear most frequently? (popularity signal)
   - Which entities are most important to understanding your primary entity? (semantic relevance)
   - Create a tiered list: core entities (2-3 most important), supporting entities (secondary), tertiary entities
   - This becomes your site's "localized knowledge graph"

**Output:** Entity map showing primary entity at center, surrounded by ranked core/supporting/tertiary entities with relationships documented.

### Step 2: Topic Cluster Expansion

Develop comprehensive content addressing 2-3 core entities with equal breadth and depth to establish topical authority.

**Approach:**

1. **Select 2-3 core entities** (from Step 1's ranked list)
   - Should be closely related to primary entity
   - Should collectively represent the breadth of your expertise
   - Each should warrant comprehensive coverage (10-20+ pages of content)
   - Avoid too many; focus builds authority

2. **Audit existing coverage**
   - For each core entity: How many pages address it? How deeply?
   - Document coverage gaps (topics not yet covered, shallow treatment, outdated information)
   - Identify cannibalization (multiple pages competing on same entity)

3. **Create pillar pages**
   - Designate one comprehensive "cornerstone" page per core entity
   - This becomes the authoritative, canonical page for that entity on your site
   - Should comprehensively cover the entity's definition, properties, importance, relationships to other entities
   - Target: 3,000-5,000+ words with deep coverage
   - Include schema markup explicitly stating this is the "about" page for the entity

4. **Develop cluster content**
   - Create supporting pages exploring specific aspects of each core entity
   - Link all cluster pages back to the pillar page for that entity
   - Develop pages around:
     - Entity attributes (properties, features, characteristics)
     - Related entities (how core entity connects to other things)
     - Use cases and applications
     - Comparisons with similar entities
     - History and evolution
   - Cluster pages can be 1,500-3,000 words

5. **Cross-entity linking**
   - Link between pillar pages to show relationships between core entities
   - If covering both "machine learning" and "deep learning": link ML pillar → DL pillar with contextual explanation of relationship
   - Help Google understand how your core entities relate to each other

**Coverage standard:** Each core entity should have comparable breadth and depth. Avoid situation where one entity gets 30 pages but another gets 3; Google interprets this as uneven expertise.

**Output:** 
- Documented pillar pages (one per core entity)
- Documented cluster pages for each entity (organized by theme: attributes, relationships, use cases, etc.)
- Cross-entity linking map showing relationships
- Gap analysis showing which entity clusters need additional coverage

---

### Step 3: Entity-Based Internal Linking

Structure internal links around entities to direct link authority to authoritative pages and help Google understand topical relationships.

**Principles:**

1. **One authoritative page per entity**
   - Designate single canonical page per entity (typically the pillar page)
   - All internal links to that entity should point to the same URL
   - Avoids link authority fragmentation and cannibalization
   - Example: If you have pages on "SEO" at /seo, /search-engine-optimization, /seo-basics, consolidate or 301-redirect to single canonical: /seo

2. **Link related entity mentions**
   - When your content mentions an entity, link to your site's authoritative page for that entity
   - Use natural anchor text (the entity name or natural variation, not keyword-stuffed)
   - Link first mention, then periodically if it reappears in long content
   - Example: "Search engines use entity recognition to understand query intent" → link "entity recognition" to your entity recognition page

3. **Use natural anchor text**
   - Anchor text should be the entity name or a natural variant
   - Not: "learn more about machine learning here" (generic)
   - Yes: "machine learning" or "ML" or "machine learning algorithms" (entity-focused)
   - Consistency: use the same anchor text for the same entity across pages

4. **Incorporate synonyms and related terms**
   - If entity has multiple names/aliases, link all variants to the same canonical page
   - Example: "AI", "artificial intelligence", "machine intelligence", "AI systems" all link to one canonical AI page
   - Helps Google consolidate topical authority around single entity

5. **Prevent topic cannibalization**
   - Audit: does any entity have multiple pages competing for ranking?
   - If yes: consolidate (merge content into one page), canonical tag (signal which is primary), or 301 redirect (move authority to canonical page)
   - Cannibalization signals divided expertise; single authoritative page signals mastery

**Entity linking checklist:**
- [ ] Identified 2-3 core entities for your site
- [ ] Designated one authoritative page per entity
- [ ] Audited existing pages for entity mentions
- [ ] Added internal links from mentions to authoritative page for that entity
- [ ] Ensured anchor text uses entity name (not generic "learn more" text)
- [ ] Verified no cannibalization (only one page per entity receives authority)
- [ ] Tested: following internal links on key entities consistently reaches same authoritative page
- [ ] Added cross-entity links showing how core entities relate

## Making Google Identify Your Entities

### Schema Markup Implementation

Add "about" schema markup to your pillar and important content pages to explicitly state which entities they cover:

```json
{
  "@context": "https://schema.org",
  "@type": "WebPage",
  "about": [
    {
      "@type": "Thing",
      "name": "Machine Learning",
      "sameAs": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_learning",
      "url": "https://yoursite.com/machine-learning"
    },
    {
      "@type": "Thing",
      "name": "Artificial Intelligence",
      "sameAs": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence",
      "url": "https://yoursite.com/artificial-intelligence"
    }
  ]
}
```

**Three components:**
1. **Type**: Use schema.org type (Thing, Person, Place, Organization, Product, etc.)
2. **Name**: Entity name exactly as it appears in Knowledge Graph
3. **sameAs**: Link to authoritative external entity reference (Wikipedia URL, Wikidata, Freebase, CrunchBase for businesses)

**Where to add:**
- Pillar pages (must-have)
- High-value cluster pages (recommended)
- Homepage (if primary entity is your business/brand)

**What it accomplishes:**
- Disambiguates which real-world entities your page is about
- Signals topical relevance to Google Knowledge Graph
- Enables entity cards and knowledge panels in SERPs
- Helps AI systems identify entities in your content

## Entity Authority Building

### Establishing Entity Presence

**For individual entities (people, experts):**
- Wikipedia page establishing notability (high bar; not attainable for most)
- Consistent online presence (same name/credentials across platforms)
- Author bios with entity identity (link author page to author's entities)
- Byline prominence (show author is associated with entity expertise)

**For business entities:**
- CrunchBase profile (if startup/tech company)
- LinkedIn company page
- Industry-specific directories (AngelList for startups, Chamber of Commerce for local businesses)
- Schema markup linking to external entity references:

```json
{
  "@type": "Organization",
  "name": "Your Company",
  "sameAs": [
    "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Your_Company",
    "https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/your-company",
    "https://www.linkedin.com/company/your-company"
  ]
}
```

**Benefit:** Multiple authoritative references (CrunchBase, LinkedIn, Wikipedia) reinforce entity disambiguation and establish your organization as a recognized entity.

## Entity SEO and AI Optimization

**Critical insight:** Optimizing for entity-based SEO simultaneously optimizes for AI search systems.

**Why:** AI systems (ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini) don't directly crawl the web. Instead, they:
1. Query search engine indexes for information about entities
2. Use APIs to retrieve entity data
3. Rely on entity recognition in retrieved documents

**Implication:** Both traditional search and AI search depend on entity recognition. Entity-based content structure makes your pages valuable to both audiences.

**Tactical connection:** A page deeply covering one entity with clear entity linking:
- Ranks better in traditional search (topical authority, Knowledge Graph integration)
- Provides better context to AI systems querying for information about that entity
- Appears more relevant to AI systems recognizing entities in queries/responses

---

## Measurement and Iteration

**Metrics to track:**
- **Entity card appearances**: Monitor branded search to see if Knowledge Graph shows entity cards for your core entities
- **Impressions by entity**: Use Search Console to segment by entity (requires custom dimension or URL structure)
- **Click-through from entity cards**: Track traffic from entity card clicks vs. traditional link clicks
- **Topical coverage**: Audit entity mentions and linking to verify coverage is expanding

**Iteration cycle:**
1. Implement entity extraction and map existing coverage (Month 1)
2. Develop topic clusters for 2-3 core entities (Months 2-4)
3. Implement entity-based internal linking (Month 1 ongoing)
4. Add schema markup (Month 1)
5. Monitor Search Console for entity card appearances (Month 2+)
6. Identify coverage gaps and develop new content (continuous)
7. Measure impressions and CTR before/after (Month 4, then ongoing)

**Success indicator:** 440% impression increases and 52% CTR improvements (per Inlinks case study) are documented outcomes; realistic timelines are 3-6 months depending on domain authority and content volume.
