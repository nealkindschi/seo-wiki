## Priority Framework

Per [[ahrefs-beginner-guide-technical-seo]], not all technical work is
equally valuable: content and links typically provide better returns than
technical optimization for most sites. Focus on **high-impact projects**
(indexing, link recovery) before medium-priority work (Core Web Vitals,
hreflang). The checklist below is tiered accordingly.


# Technical SEO Audit Checklist

**Why/when to use this:** run through this when auditing a site's
technical foundation — the fundamentals that determine whether a page
can be crawled, indexed, and rendered correctly at all, which is a
prerequisite for both classic search ranking and AI-generated-answer
citation (see [[how-google-search-works]] and
[[generative-engine-optimization]]'s "retrieval eligibility"). Based on
[[semrush-technical-seo-checklist]] and [[google-search-fundamentals-get-started]].

## 1. Crawling and indexing

- **Check indexing status** in Google Search Console's "Pages" report.
  Common exclusion reasons to investigate: *Crawled - currently not
  indexed* (usually low-quality or duplicate content), *Blocked by
  robots.txt* (often unintentional), *Excluded by 'noindex' tag*
  (confirm it's deliberate).
- **Consolidate duplicate URL versions** (http/https, with/without
  www) with 301 redirects to a single preferred (HTTPS) version.
  Implement canonicalization (canonical tags) preventatively on pages
  where duplicates might naturally occur (session tracking, filter
  parameters, syndication).
- **Audit robots.txt for crawl strategy, not indexing control** — per
  [[google-search-fundamentals-get-started]], robots.txt controls
  crawling (whether Google fetches the page), not indexing (whether it
  gets added to the index). Use robots.txt strategically to block
  duplicate, temporary, or low-priority pages to preserve crawl budget.
  Don't rely on robots.txt to prevent indexing — use the `noindex` meta
  tag or login requirements instead.
- **Submit a sitemap** (especially important if content changes
  frequently or pages aren't easily discoverable through internal links).
  Per [[google-sitemaps-overview]], create sitemaps if your site has 500+
  pages, is newly launched with few backlinks, or has substantial
  video/image/news content. Use specialized sitemaps (news/video/image)
  for media-rich content to enable media-specific search features.
  **Important**: Sitemap inclusion doesn't guarantee indexing — it's a
  discovery tool, not an indexing guarantee. In Search Console, verify:
  (1) sitemap is submitted and processed, (2) GSC Sitemaps report shows
  count of URLs discovered, (3) monitor for errors/warnings, (4) track
  indexation status (crawled, indexed, excluded).
- **Fix redirect chains** (A→B→C) **and loops** (circular redirects).
- **Fix broken links** — restore or 301-redirect broken internal links;
  update or remove broken external links.
- **Resolve server errors** — audit for 5xx errors and escalate
  specific codes to engineering.

Tools: Google Search Console, Bing Webmaster Tools, IndexNow, a
site-crawl tool (e.g. Semrush Site Audit) for chains/broken
links/5xx/orphan-page detection at scale.

**Prevalence and priority calibration**, per
[[ahrefs-site-audit-study-2023]] (1M+ domains): redirects and HTTPS
migration are near-universal (95.2% and 88% of domains respectively)
and mostly benign on their own — the actual risk is redirect *chains*
beyond ~10 hops (breaks signal/link-equity consolidation to the final
URL) or a misdirected HTTPS→HTTP redirect (found on 6%+ of sites, the
wrong direction). Don't treat "redirect present" as an issue by
itself; audit for chains, loops, and wrong-direction redirects
specifically.

## 2. User experience

- **Mobile-first indexing is now the default pattern** — Google crawls
  and indexes primarily with its mobile crawler, not desktop. Over 60%
  of internet traffic is mobile. Test the mobile experience first, not
  as an afterthought.
- **Mobile-friendliness**: check for text too small to read without
  zooming, tap targets too close together, content wider than the
  viewport (horizontal scroll), and pop-ups blocking main content on
  load.
- **Core Web Vitals** — three thresholds:
  - **LCP** (Largest Contentful Paint): ≤ 2.5 seconds.
  - **INP** (Interaction to Next Paint): < 200 milliseconds.
  - **CLS** (Cumulative Layout Shift): < 0.1.
  Tools: GSC's Core Web Vitals report, Google PageSpeed Insights.
- **Avoid intrusive interstitials**: full-screen pop-ups on arrival,
  overlays requiring dismissal before content is visible, ad layouts
  pushing main content below the fold. Legitimate exceptions: cookie
  notices, age verification, paywalls.

## 3. Navigation and internal linking

See [[link-and-anchor-text-best-practices]] for the full internal-
linking playbook (site structure, anchor text, cornerstone content,
audit workflow). Quick-reference for this audit:

- [ ] Pyramid site structure, every important page within ~3-4 clicks
      of the homepage.
- [ ] Breadcrumbs present and accurate.
- [ ] No orphan pages (zero inbound internal links).
- [ ] Descriptive anchor text, not "click here"/"read more."

## 4. Code and configuration

- **HTTPS** — SSL/TLS on every page; a confirmed Google ranking signal
  since 2014, and modern browsers flag non-HTTPS pages as "Not Secure."
- **hreflang for international content** — specify language/regional
  page variants in `<head>`:
  `<link rel="alternate" hreflang="en-us" href="..."/>`, with an
  `x-default` fallback tag for unmatched locales.
- **Schema markup** (per [[google-search-fundamentals-get-started]]) —
  helps both search engines and AI systems identify content type,
  authorship, dates, and entities, and enables rich results and
  enhanced search appearance. Not required for ranking, but can improve
  CTR and user experience via rich snippets, cards, and other enhanced
  SERP features. Common types: Organization, Product, Article, Event,
  Recipe, Review, FAQPage. Tools: a schema generator, Google's Rich
  Results Test, Schema.org documentation.
- **On-page element priority calibration**, per
  [[ahrefs-site-audit-study-2023]] (1M+ domains) — these are among the
  most commonly-flagged issues in a site audit, but not equally
  important:
  - **Title tags are worth fixing** (found mismatched/overlong on
    63-68% of domains) — they remain an actual ranking factor; Google
    ranks against the full tag text, not the truncated SERP display.
    Prioritize pages that already get meaningful search traffic.
  - **Meta descriptions are not a ranking factor** — Google rewrites
    them in the SERP roughly 63% of the time regardless of what's
    written. Only worth deliberately writing/fixing on high-traffic
    pages or pages with a distinct selling proposition; not worth a
    site-wide mass-fix effort.
  - **Missing alt attributes** (found on 80.4% of domains) matter more
    for accessibility/legal compliance (ADA lawsuits are a real risk)
    than for SEO directly — still fix them, but for the right reason.
  - **Multiple or missing H1 tags are low-severity.** Multiple H1s
    have been valid HTML5 since 2014 and Google has stated this isn't
    a problem; a missing H1 is a minor issue. Don't over-prioritize
    either.
  - **Open Graph tags are a social/CTR lever, not an SEO ranking
    factor** — only worth completing for pages that actually get
    shared on social platforms.
  - **General framework**: use an impact-effort matrix rather than
    fixing issues in order of how common they are — prevalence in an
    audit tool indicates commonality, not priority. Sometimes the
    right call is to leave a low-impact issue unfixed if the
    development cost outweighs the benefit.

## 5. AI grounding and agent readiness

- **Check AI crawler access in robots.txt separately from regular
  search bots** — named AI bots include OpenAI's GPTBot (training),
  OAI-SearchBot (search indexing), and ChatGPT-User (live retrieval),
  and Anthropic's ClaudeBot (training), Claude-SearchBot (search
  indexing), and Claude-User (live retrieval) — each vendor's bots map
  onto the training/indexing/retrieval taxonomy in
  [[how-google-search-works]]. (The original
  [[semrush-technical-seo-checklist]] source named "Claude-Web," an
  older Anthropic agent since superseded by the bots above — bot names
  change over time, so verify current names against each vendor's
  crawler documentation when auditing.) Confirm any "disallow"
  targeting them is intentional; see
  [[controlling-ai-feature-inclusion]] if you *do* want to deliberately
  exclude content from AI features specifically (a different, opposite
  goal from this checklist item).
- **Use semantic HTML**, not generic divs/spans, so crawlers and AI
  agents can map structure to meaning: `<header>` (logo/nav),
  `<h1>` (main heading), `<nav>` (navigation), `<main>` (primary
  content), `<h2>` (subheadings), `<footer>`.
- **Analyze server logs for AI bot activity**, per
  [[peec-ai-server-logs-ai-search-2026]] — confirm all three AI bot
  types (training, search/indexing, user-query/retrieval; see
  [[how-google-search-works]]) are actually visiting, not just
  present in robots.txt as allowed. Then cross-reference crawl
  frequency against citation-tracking data for high-value pages: a
  page crawled often but rarely cited signals one of three distinct
  problems — technical access/rendering failure, content-quality
  rejection (the LLM sees the page but chooses not to use it), or a
  gap in the citation-monitoring tool's prompt coverage. Rule out
  access problems before assuming a content-quality issue.
- **AI search-specific technical risks** (per
  [[ahrefs-beginner-guide-technical-seo]]) — distinct from traditional
  search crawlability:
  - **JavaScript rendering**: Most LLMs don't render JavaScript, so
    mission-critical content that only appears after JS execution is
    invisible to AI crawlers. Test whether key content is visible in the
    page source/HTML without running JS.
  - **Third-party blocking**: Cloudflare, Sucuri, and similar security
    services may block AI crawlers by default. Check your CDN/WAF
    settings if you want AI visibility; whitelist AI bot IPs if needed.
  - **Hallucinated URLs**: AI systems sometimes cite non-existent URLs on
    your domain. Monitor Web Analytics for AI referral traffic and set up
    redirects from common 404s to relevant live pages (e.g.,
    `/products/nonexistent-item` → `/products/` or search page).
  - **Code fingerprints**: AI tools may inject identifiable HTML into
    pages to track their presence. Review source code before publishing,
    especially if using third-party tools to generate or modify content.
  - **AI content detection**: Excessive AI-generated content without human
    review can signal spam to both search engines and AI systems. Audit
    content authenticity — use AI detectors to identify which pages are
    wholly or predominantly AI-written if you're uncertain.

- **Ecommerce/agentic-commerce readiness** — relevant if AI shopping
  agents may transact on your site, not just cite it:
  - Keep product Schema accurate and real-time (price, availability).
  - Test your checkout flow with an agentic shopping tool (e.g. ChatGPT
    Shopping) to confirm an agent can actually complete a purchase.
  - Keep policy pages (returns, shipping, FAQs) in plain HTML, not
    behind JS-only rendering or PDFs.
  - Use standard HTML form fields and buttons — avoid custom
    JS-only input components an agent can't reliably operate.
  - Ensure critical-path functionality (forms, checkout, modals) works
    without JavaScript, or fails gracefully if it doesn't.
  - Make cookie/login modals dismissable via standard HTML buttons, not
    JS-only interaction patterns.
  - Avoid dynamic checkout flows that don't reflect state changes in
    the HTML/DOM itself — an agent needs the page's HTML to be a
    truthful record of current state, not just visually correct after
    client-side JS runs.
