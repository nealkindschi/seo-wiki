# Optimizing for the Agentic Web

**Why/when to use this:** apply when you want AI agents (ChatGPT,
Gemini, Perplexity, and similar) to not just cite your site but
successfully *act* on it — browse, evaluate, and complete a task like a
signup or purchase on a user's behalf. Based on
[[agentic-web-optimization]] / [[semrush-optimize-for-agentic-web]].
Layer 1 (technical SEO foundations) is covered by
[[technical-seo-audit-checklist]] — this playbook picks up from layer 2.

## First: unblock and verify (agent experience)

Before polishing content, confirm a buyer's agent can actually reach
and read your pages. Per [[ora-ax-is-the-new-aeo-2026]] / [[agent-experience-ax]],
blocked agents answer anyway from third-party sources. That cuts clear
recommendations by about half and makes answers 3.7× likelier to omit
every fact the buyer asked about.

- **Test with real agents.** Ask Claude/ChatGPT-style agents your top
  buyer questions (pricing, free tier/trial, features, setup,
  comparisons) and check whether the answer cites *your* pages or
  aggregators and competitor blogs. Watch for hedges like "the site
  returned 403," "contact sales for a quote," or vouching via review
  sites. These are the hedge patterns that grow most when an agent
  can't read you.
- **Remove unintended blocks.** Audit robots.txt AI user-agent rules
  (see [[robots-txt-strategy]]), WAF/bot-protection, CAPTCHA, and
  rate-limit rules for 403s on agent fetches. Blocking agents is not
  the same decision as blocking training crawlers.
- **Publish pricing as readable text on your own site.** Pricing showed
  the biggest own-site accuracy gain (60% vs 37%) because your site is
  its only fresh source.
- **Make setup/onboarding docs findable.** Two-thirds of setup facts
  never surfaced in the study. Findability, not source, was what
  moved setup accuracy (31% vs 18%).
- **Answer the "what can I try for free?" class of question directly**
  on a crawlable page. In the study's example trace, one site answered
  from its own docs while a blocked site's journey ended on two
  competitors' blogs.
- **Watch the connector/registry layer** (see layer 5 below): if your
  category's assistants start checking connectors before the web, a
  registry/plugin listing becomes part of being findable.

## Layer 2: Make content agent-parseable

- **Write plainly**: state what the product/page does, who it's for,
  and what problem it solves in direct sentences — don't make an agent
  infer this from marketing copy.
- **Structure for scanning**: use headings, short paragraphs, and
  bullets so an agent can isolate discrete, self-contained units of
  information rather than parsing a wall of text.
- **Lead with the point**: open each section with the takeaway, then
  supporting detail — agents (like time-pressed human readers) often
  need the answer before the justification.
- **Answer real buyer questions** via FAQ sections built around
  questions people actually ask, not generic marketing FAQs.
- **Use Schema markup**: Product schema (price, availability, ratings),
  FAQ schema (question-answer pairs), Organization schema (entity
  clarity) — reinforces what the plain-language content already says,
  machine-readably.

## Layer 3: Keep off-site presence consistent

- **Match brand name, product description, and value proposition
  across every platform** you appear on — an agent that synthesizes
  from multiple sources will get confused (or pick a competitor) if
  your own story is inconsistent site-to-site.
- **Earn mentions deliberately**, the same channels that build classic
  authority also feed agent training/retrieval data:
  - Digital PR — pitch data-driven stories to journalists for expert-
    commentary inclusion.
  - Guest posting on respected category blogs, with an author bio that
    names your brand/product.
  - "Best of" roundup inclusion — proactively pitch roundup publishers
    with copy and screenshots ready to use.
  - Review generation — encourage genuine customer reviews on
    G2/Capterra/Trustpilot-type platforms; these are exactly the kind
    of independent, comparison-friendly source citation-focused GEO
    also rewards (see [[growth-memo-why-most-original-data-never-gets-cited]]
    on the value of comparison-formatted content).

## Layer 4: Make the interface actually operable by an agent

An agent needs to *complete a task*, not just read the page — this is
the layer that has no equivalent in citation-focused GEO:

- **Label CTAs clearly.** "Learn more" or "Get started" doesn't tell an
  agent what action it triggers or what happens next — name the
  action.
- **Never lock essential info in images.** Pricing, plan details, specs
  must be in accessible text an agent can read and act on, not baked
  into a pricing-table screenshot.
- **Remove blocking overlays from task flows.** A pop-up or modal that
  interrupts mid-signup or mid-checkout can strand an agent the same
  way it frustrates a human — worse, since the agent may not know how
  to dismiss a non-standard overlay (see
  [[technical-seo-audit-checklist]]'s "dismissable via standard HTML
  buttons" guidance).
- **Keep signup/checkout flows simple and clearly labeled** end-to-end
  so an agent can confirm pricing and complete the flow without
  needing to interpret ambiguous UI.

## Layer 5: Consider the protocol layer (early-stage)

Four standards have shipped in the last ~18 months (as of mid-2026);
adoption is still narrow, but worth tracking and piloting if your
category is agentic-commerce-relevant (ecommerce, SaaS, travel,
services):

- **MCP** (Anthropic, Nov 2024) — the most mature; if you run a SaaS
  product, an MCP server exposing key actions (data pulls, report
  generation) is the most proven integration point today.
- **WebMCP** (Google/Microsoft, W3C draft Feb 2026) — browser-native
  on-page task execution; not production-ready yet, but track for when
  it matures.
- **ACP** (OpenAI/Stripe, Sept 2025) — if you sell products and
  ChatGPT-driven purchases matter to your category, evaluate ACP
  integration for in-chat checkout (currently limited to select U.S.
  merchants).
- **UCP** (Google, announced Jan 2026, Shopify/Walmart/Target as
  partners) — broader commerce-standardization play; evaluate if
  you're ecommerce and already integrated with a UCP launch partner's
  platform.

Don't over-invest here yet relative to layers 1-4 — this layer is
explicitly early/narrow-adoption, but the shipping pace (4 standards in
18 months) suggests it's worth a standing watch item, not a one-time
check.

## Measurement framework

**Visibility metrics** (how much agents talk about you):
- **AI Visibility Score** — a 0-100 relative-to-competitors score
  (vendor-specific metric, e.g. Semrush's AI Visibility tool).
- **Mentions** — raw count of brand-name appearances in AI responses,
  tracked with trend-over-time and per-model breakdown.
- **Citations** — instances where an AI quotes your content and links
  back; track a "citation gap" specifically — prompts where competitors
  are cited but you aren't, since those are your clearest content gaps.

**Action metrics** (how much agents actually drive/complete tasks):
- **AI-Referred Sessions** — set up a referral-source segment for
  chatgpt.com / gemini.google.com / perplexity.ai (and similar) in your
  analytics tool. Note: cited research puts the average AI-referred
  visitor's conversion value at ~4.4x a traditional organic visitor —
  worth weighting this segment's priority accordingly even at lower
  volume (see [[aio-ctr-impact]] for related AI-traffic economics).
- **AI Bot Traffic** — server-log analysis of which AI crawlers hit
  your site and how often; distinct from referred *sessions*, since
  this captures crawl/retrieval activity even when it doesn't result in
  a human-visible visit.
- **AI-Assisted Conversions** — apply your existing conversion goals
  (signups, purchases, demo requests) to the AI-referred segment
  specifically, so you can see conversion rate/value split out from
  your aggregate traffic.

**Known limitation**: direct agent-activity tracking isn't yet
possible — no tool currently instruments "an agent completed this task
on your site" directly. The above metrics (referral segments + server
logs + conversion goals applied to that segment) are the best current
approximation, not a ground-truth measurement.
