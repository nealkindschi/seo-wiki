Why / when to use this: as a site accumulates content, some pages stop
earning their keep — thin, outdated, cannibalizing, or simply ignored
by both users and search engines. Pruning reclaims link authority and
crawl budget for the pages that matter. Run it as an ongoing cadence,
not a one-time cleanup; pairs with
[[keyword-mapping-and-cannibalization]] (cannibalization is one of the
audit triggers here) and [[technical-seo-audit-checklist]] (for the
noindex/redirect mechanics).

## Why prune

- Removes non-value-adding material, improving overall site quality
- Redistributes link authority toward high-potential pages
- Improves user experience (visitors find current, relevant content)
- Frees crawl budget for important pages — matters most on sites with
  10,000+ pages

## Cadence

Continuous and staged, not an annual purge:
- Sites up to ~1,000 pages: full pass every 6 months
- Larger sites: every 3 months
- Fold a lightweight check into monthly content work

## Process

1. **Inventory** — build a complete list of URLs/pages/images/videos/
   PDFs from CMS exports, web analytics, Google Search Console, Bing
   Webmaster Tools, and backlink data (e.g. Ahrefs). Record each item's
   goal, target audience, and target keyword.
2. **Audit** — score each item on: 12-month traffic and conversions,
   organic traffic specifically, internal/external link counts, social
   performance, outdated-information presence, thin-content signals, and
   cannibalization with other pages (see
   [[keyword-mapping-and-cannibalization]] for the cannibalization
   diagnostic in detail). Set a concrete threshold rather than judging
   case-by-case — e.g. flag anything under 1,000 monthly organic
   sessions — so the audit stays consistent across a large page set.
3. **Check backlinks before deciding anything** — pull backlink data
   (Ahrefs, Semrush Backlinks) for every flagged page. Substantial
   external link equity is a strong reason to refresh or consolidate
   rather than remove, regardless of how the traffic/content signals
   look in isolation.
4. **Decide fate** — flag anything with zero organic/general traffic,
   minimal internal/external links, poor social performance, stale
   facts, thin content, or cannibalization.

## Alternatives to deletion (in order of lightest touch)

1. **Improve** — refresh title tags, meta descriptions, and headings;
   add recent developments; cut outdated sections. Cheapest fix, try
   first.
2. **Trim, update, consolidate** — merge weak/overlapping pages into one
   stronger article (this is the same fix
   [[keyword-mapping-and-cannibalization]] recommends for cannibalized
   keyword pairs); add visible update dates/disclaimers to aging content
   instead of a full rewrite.
3. **Make non-indexable** — `noindex` pages that serve users but carry
   no SEO value (e.g. blog tag/archive pages); canonicalize duplicate
   PDFs to their parent page rather than letting them compete in the
   index.
4. **Remove** — last resort, and only staged: delete in batches,
   monitor impact for 1-3 weeks between batches, and bucket pages by
   severity (traffic, backlinks, engagement) so the riskiest deletions
   go last, once you've validated the pattern on lower-risk pages.
   Removal creates a 404 by default — it loses whatever organic traffic
   the page had and breaks any internal links still pointing to it, so
   only remove pages with no meaningful link value (internal or
   external); anything else should be refreshed or consolidated
   instead.

## Redirect discipline

Whenever pruning removes, merges, or consolidates a URL that has any
organic traffic or backlinks, 301-redirect it to the most relevant
surviving page — when consolidating duplicates, that means redirecting
to the single highest-quality version so link equity concentrates there
rather than splitting. Sloppy or missing redirects are called out
repeatedly as the actual cause of lasting traffic loss from pruning —
the pruning decision itself is rarely the problem, the redirect
execution is.

## Corroborating case study

Semrush reports its own blog saw a "substantial increase in organic
traffic" from multi-year content refreshing (the "improve" tier above,
not consolidation or removal) — first-party evidence that the
lightest-touch option alone, applied consistently over time, can move
the needle without ever deleting anything.

## Tools

Conductor (monitoring/analytics), Semrush (Site Audit, Organic Traffic
Insights, Backlinks), Google Search Console, Bing Webmaster Tools,
Ahrefs (backlinks), Screaming Frog (crawl/word-count analysis), Google
Analytics, BuzzSumo (social performance).
