# SEO/AEO LLM Wiki

A persistent, AI-maintained knowledge base of SEO and AEO (Answer Engine Optimization) best practices, tactics, strategies, studies, and reports.

Instead of re-deriving answers from raw sources on every question, this wiki incrementally builds and maintains interlinked markdown pages that compound in value over time. It's designed to be viewed in [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) (free, local, no account required) and maintained by Claude via natural-language workflows.

## Quick Start

### Viewing the Wiki

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/nealkindschi/seo-wiki.git
   cd seo-wiki
   ```

2. **Open in Obsidian:**
   - Download [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) (free)
   - Open the `wiki/` folder as a vault
   - You can now browse pages with full link resolution, graph view, and backlink panels

3. **Start reading:**
   - Begin with [`wiki/index.md`](wiki/index.md) for a catalog of all pages
   - Check [`wiki/log.md`](wiki/log.md) for recent additions
   - View [`wiki/timeline.md`](wiki/timeline.md) for SEO/AEO events by date

## Page Types

### Concepts
Synthesis pages that explain SEO/AEO topics in depth. Include:
- Overview and current best understanding
- Links to relevant playbooks and sources
- A "Conflicting Evidence" section when sources disagree (with dates and reasoning)

**Frontmatter:**
```yaml
---
type: concept
tags: [seo, aeo]  # or just [seo] or [aeo]
updated: YYYY-MM-DD
---
```

### Playbooks
Actionable reference pages — checklists, numbered steps, tactic writeups. Include:
- Why/when to use this
- Step-by-step guidance
- Links back to supporting concepts

**Frontmatter:**
```yaml
---
type: playbook
tags: [seo]
updated: YYYY-MM-DD
---
```

### Sources
Summary pages for each ingested source (article, study, report). Include:
- Citation and link to original
- Key takeaways
- Which concepts/playbooks it updated

**Frontmatter:**
```yaml
---
type: source
tags: [aeo]
date_published: YYYY-MM-DD
date_ingested: YYYY-MM-DD
origin: raw/studies/<file>
---
```

## How It Works

### Adding Sources (Ingest)
The wiki is maintained by Claude. To add a new source:

1. **Provide the source** to Claude in any form:
   - A URL
   - A file path (e.g., `~/Downloads/report.pdf`)
   - Pasted text
   - An attached file

2. Claude will:
   - Save the source to `raw/` (you don't manually place files there)
   - Discuss key takeaways with you
   - Check for conflicts with existing pages
   - Create or update relevant concept/playbook/source pages
   - Update the index, log, and timeline

### Querying the Wiki
Ask Claude a question about SEO/AEO. Claude will:
- Find relevant pages in `wiki/index.md`
- Read supporting concept/playbook/source pages
- Answer with citations
- Optionally file the answer back into the wiki if it's a valuable synthesis

### Linking Convention
All pages use **Obsidian-style wikilinks**, never relative paths:

```markdown
[[internal-linking-best-practices]]
```

This allows Obsidian to:
- Resolve links automatically
- Power the graph view (visualize topic connections)
- Show backlink panels (what links to this page)
- Keep links valid even if pages move between folders

## Conflict Resolution

When sources disagree, the wiki **surfaces the conflict** rather than silently overwriting:

```markdown
## Conflicting Evidence

- **Claim**: <statement>
  - Supported by: [[source-x]] (date)
  - Contradicted by: [[source-y]] (date), <reason>
- **Current best guess**: <leaning>, flagged as unresolved
```

Old claims are marked with dates and reasoning, never deleted — SEO/AEO practices shift over time and it's valuable to know *when* something was true.

## Activity Tracking

### Log (`wiki/log.md`)
Append-only record of wiki activity, dated by when work was done:
```
## [2026-07-07] ingest | Title of Source
## [2026-07-07] query | "Question asked"
## [2026-07-07] conflict | Topic — brief description
## [2026-07-07] lint | findings summary
```

### Timeline (`wiki/timeline.md`)
Append-only record of real-world SEO/AEO events, dated by source publish/event date:
```
## 2026-07-07 — Event description
[[source-slug]] · [[concept-that-updated]]
```

## Viewing in Obsidian

The `wiki/` folder is a complete Obsidian vault. When you open it:

- **Graph view**: See how concepts, playbooks, and sources connect
- **Backlinks panel**: Find all pages linking to the current page
- **Wikilink resolution**: Click `[[links]]` to navigate instantly
- **Search**: Full-text search across all pages
- **Optional plugins**: Install [Dataview](https://blacksmithgu.github.io/obsidian-dataview/) to query frontmatter metadata (not required)

## Tags

Pages are tagged `[seo]`, `[aeo]`, or `[seo, aeo]` to indicate scope:
- **SEO**: Search Engine Optimization (classic Google Search)
- **AEO**: Answer Engine Optimization (AI/generative search visibility)
- **Both**: Topics that apply to both ranking systems

## Future Extensions (Out of Scope)

These are not yet implemented:
- **Live SEO tool integration** — pulling live data from Semrush/Ahrefs during queries to check claim staleness
- **Search tooling** — `index.md` is sufficient for current scale; may add if wiki grows past ~100 sources
- **Dataview plugin** — not required; optional for advanced querying
- **Auto-ingestion** — natural-language ingestion (handing sources directly to Claude) was chosen over folder-watching

## Contributing

This is an AI-maintained wiki, but improvements are welcome:

- **Found an error?** Open an issue or PR
- **Have a source to add?** Open an issue with the link/file
- **See a conflict that needs resolving?** Open an issue describing the disagreement

## License

This repository contains synthesized knowledge from multiple published sources (articles, studies, reports). Each source page links back to the original. See individual source pages for licensing of the original material.
